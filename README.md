# Quantum-Mechanics---The-Theoretical-Minimum
My "class" notes and problem solution. All are typed with MS Word and I made a pdf file of each as well.

I found this the best intro course ever for QM. Nonetheless, I was confused by lots and lots of things.

In my notes I fill in tons of details so that I could better understand.
Often I would re-order the presentation of a topic in what to me is a more logical order.
   I retained the book's equation numbers but this causes them to sometimes be a little out-of-order.
I also numbered many more equations, many in the book but un-numbered, lots of them not in the book but needed.
I prove many of the statements that were made but not proved. Again, for my own understanding.

I am sure there will be a few errors in my solved problems though I am not aware of any.
   I worked several problems that either no one else posted on the official site, or that were worked incorrectly.
   Especially Exercise 4.6 which had horribly confusing wording and fooled all the people who posted solutions.
      To their credit, everyone who posted a solution to this problem stated that it didn't make much sense.
