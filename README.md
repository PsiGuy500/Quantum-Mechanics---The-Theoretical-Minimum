# Quantum-Mechanics---The-Theoretical-Minimum
My "class" notes and problem solutions. All are typed with MS Word and I made a pdf file of each as well.

I found this the best intro course ever for QM. 
   It oscillates between being rigorous and heuristic. The heuristics provided insights but also caused confusion.

In my notes (110 pages) I fill in tons of details so that I could better understand.
   Often I would re-order the presentation of a topic to make it more rigorous.
   I retained the book's equation numbers but this causes them to sometimes be a little out-of-order in my notes.
   I also numbered many more equations, many in the book but un-numbered, lots of them not in the book but needed.
   I prove many of the statements that were made but not proved. Again, for my own understanding.

I am sure there will be a few errors in my solved problems though I am not aware of any.
   I worked several problems that either no one else posted on the official site, or that were worked incorrectly.
   In particular, I worked Exercise 4.6, which I believe was mis-stated. 
   Those who posted a solution to this problem stated that it didn't make much sense. 
   I believe it was meant to build on 3 prior exercises, bringing an entire topic to a conclusion.
